# Wordle Assignment

This repository contains a simple web‑based implementation of the popular word puzzle game **Wordle** built as part of an academic exercise. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate mastery of core front‑end concepts including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, event handling, network requests and basic game logic.

## How to run locally

1. Clone this repository to your computer:

   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your favourite browser. No build step is required.

The game picks a random five‑letter word and allows six guesses. Use your keyboard to type letters, press **Backspace** to delete and **Enter** to submit. Colours indicate whether letters are correct (green), present but misplaced (yellow) or absent (gray).
